### Practice

Your task for this week is to implement POS statistical tagger model. You can choose one of the several options
* If you prefer notebooks, pick `tagger.ipynb`. Submit the notebook with your results
* If you want good old-fashioned python, pick `tagger.py` instead. Submit that file along with your training results (text or plots)


There's also an optional task, `rnn_tagger.ipynb` - it attempts the same task with neural networks. __You are not required to do that task__. However, if you got through it, you are eligible for some bonus points AND a a great opportunity to beat classical methods with deep learning :)
