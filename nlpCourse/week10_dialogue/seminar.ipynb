    "\n",
    "Not all wrong answers are equally wrong. As the training progresses, _most negative examples $a^-$ will be to easy._ So easy in fact, that loss function and gradients on such negatives is exactly __0.0__. To improve training efficiency, one can __mine hard negative samples__.\n",

    "* __Semi-hard negative__ is the one with highest similarity _among wrong answers that are farther than positive one. This option is more useful if some wrong answers may actually be mislabelled correct answers.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to implement at least __hard negative__ sampling and apply it for model training.\n",

    "### 2. Bring Your Own Model (3+ pts)\n",
    "In addition to Universal Sentence Encoder, one can also train a new model.\n",
    "* You name it: convolutions, RNN, self-attention\n",
    "* Use pre-trained ELMO or FastText embeddings\n",
    "* Monitor overfitting and use dropout / word dropout to improve performance\n",

    "### 3. Search engine (3+ pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our basic model only selects answers from 2-5 available sentences in paragraph. You can extend it to search over __the whole dataset__. All sentences in all other paragraphs are viable answers.\n",

    "* You can ask such model a question of your own making - to see which answers it can find among the entire training dataset or even the entire wikipedia.\n",
    "* Searching for top-K neighbors is easier if you use specialized methods: [KD-Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KDTree.html) or [HNSW](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib). \n",
    "* This task is much easier to train if you use hard or semi-hard negatives. You can even find hard negatives for one question from correct answers to other questions in batch - do so in-graph for maximum efficiency. See [1.] for more details.\n"
